## 3. Monetization Triggers (Soft, Contextual)

### Trigger Rule #1: Capability Paywall
**When:** User hits limit on free tier of unlocked capability  
**Example:** 4th deal comparison created  
**Message:**
```
"You've created 3 comparisons.
Upgrade to save unlimited analyses and share with your team."
```
**Presentation:** Modal or sidebar nudge (not blocking, dismissible)  
**Timing:** After action completed, not mid-action

### Trigger Rule #2: Value Gap Moment
**When:** User explores advanced feature without premium  
**Example:** Clicking "Create Scenario" on Tier 2  
**Message:**
```
"Test unlimited scenarios.
Premium members can model any strategy change and see projections instantly."
```
**Presentation:** Lightweight modal with preview  
**Timing:** Right after discovering the limitation

### Trigger Rule #3: Ecosystem Expansion
**When:** User achieves power-user status (70+ score)  
**Message:**
```
"You're now a power investor.
Access our premium community, expert signals, and advanced tools built for serious investors."
```
**Presentation:** Upgrade card in dashboard or email  
**Timing:** After hitting power-user threshold

### Trigger Rule #4: Retention/Premium Deepening
**When:** Paying user hasn't used premium feature in 7+ days  
**Message:**
```
"Your scenario modeling is powerful—here's what other users created this week."
```
**Presentation:** Email digest or in-app highlight  
**Timing:** Weekly for premium users

### Rules for All Monetization Moments
✅ **Never block existing workflows** — offer upgrade, allow dismiss  
✅ **Show value preview** — explain benefit before paywall  
✅ **Offer dismiss-and-continue** — don't force immediate decision  
✅ **No urgency pressure** — no timers, no "limited offer"  
✅ **Max 1 upgrade prompt per session** — avoid fatigue  
✅ **Respect dismissals** — cooldown 7 days before re-showing same moment
